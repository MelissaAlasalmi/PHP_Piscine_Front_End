# PHP_Piscine_Balloon

This file creates an interactive "balloon" in a web browser.
See it in action here: https://melissaalasalmi.github.io/PHP_Piscine_Balloon/balloon.html 
- Every time the balloon is clicked, its color will change from red to green, to blue - following this color sequence with each click. 
- With each click, its size will also grow by 10px.
- If the size of the balloon becomes greater than 420px, it will return to its original size.
- In addition, when the balloon is moused over (hovering over the balloon with the mouse, then moving the mouse away), the size of the balloon will shrink by 5px.
- The balloon cannot go lower than 200px in size.
- For each mouseover, its color will also change in the reverse order of the sequence in point one - from blue to green, to red, etc.
